This service is setup to be simple for the purposes of wiring up an example.  It will not handle horizontal scaling,
for example.  Also the data layer is mostly bogus.

In ideal conditions the following would be a generally more appropriate direction.  The log layer could be sent out
as events in a stream to something like Kinesis and stored however might be preferred or even trigger lambdas to further
interrogate.  On the side of the files, they really should be stored into S3 or another storage solution with better
handling of large mostly static content.
