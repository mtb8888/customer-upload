This setup is going to be so that I can have a simple example project in a single jar. It is not representative of how
I would prefer things to be.

Ideally, a separate React / Angular / SPA style project would be preferred that has independence in terms of
build, deployment, and runtime.  While sharing the Bounded Context for the supporting service(s).

Looking into the options available with my current setup, it brings up more issues with not having a standalone.
In a react app I could have data being polled by a component and updating it's state for passing down into more
specific components to deal with table/row concerns.  Now with this style, it will have to follow a more hardwired
model environment from the WebController, I don't think I can make calls to UploadController from those pages.  Likely,
the output here is going to be messy, if I can even get it working.  The intent, however, was to have a table with
filenames and clickable link that would either save a file from the binary in model or call back out to download from
UploadController with an id.

So the above turns out to have some issues with how to get the templates calling the endpoints I want.  Hopefully,
what I've at least put into the files makes sense to read for goal, if not functionally correct.
